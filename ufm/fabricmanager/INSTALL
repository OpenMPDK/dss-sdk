It's strongly recommended to install FabricManager using your OS's package
system rather than using setup.py yourself.  You can find instructions
for many distributions at:

  https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/introduction.html

Manpages are available in the 'doc' directory.

To install properly, run:

    ./setup.py install --record=install-files.txt

See --help for an overview of the available options; e.g. --prefix to
install to a custom base directory, and --without-gettext to avoid
installing natural language support files.

setup.py supports basic uninstallation provided --record was used for
installation as above:

    ./setup.py uninstall --manifest=install-files.txt
